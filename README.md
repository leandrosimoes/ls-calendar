# ls-calendar
Calendar app made for the Vanhack HTML, CSS, Javascript code challenge

## Proposal

Make a `calendar app`. The calendar should display all the dates for the current month. The calendar app should also be able to mark appointments. The app must have the following functionality:
- Any appointment can be made for the current day or for a future date.
- No two appointments should overlap. If an appointment already exists for a day, a warning should be shown.
- Appointments can be edited and deleted.

## Rules

- This specific test requires manual evaluation. This means your score will be lower than 25% until someone manually evaluates your Calendar APP. It may take up to a week for it to be evaluated.
- Do not forget to manually submit your code.
- You may use Bootstrap and/or jQuery, but we won't be able to give you support if you experience any kind of bugs with these tools.
- Once you click on "Start Challenge", you will have 7 days to complete it. There will be a timer on the page with the questions. VanHack will not give deadline extensions.
- Your code may be submitted to companies so they can review it, and will be available on your profile so all employers can see it. This means you should do your best. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- You may cancel this challenge on your VanHack Profile. If you cancel a challenge you have already started, you will only be able to retake it in three months. If you have not started the challenge yet, you will be able to retake it whenever you wish.
